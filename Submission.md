<h2> Name:  MachoMara </h2>
<h2> Category: Web3 Integration in Web2 </h2>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

The Masai Mara people are very conservative in nature, with most of them relying on agricultural activities like farming or keeping livestock, only few are educated.
Landowners, wildlife, and tourism all rely on one another to survive in the Masai Mara. The effects of COVID-19 have halted travel, jeopardized prior earnings, and raised concerns about the stability of the ecosystem.
To generate cash and protect the land for the conservation of wildlife, the Masai people lease their land to conservancies. Tourism businesses that profit from eco-tourism are granted licenses to use the land. One of the most inventive and successful conservation techniques in Africa may be essentially destroyed if individual conservancy landowners are driven to sell or convert their parcels of land to agriculture due to decreased or uncertain lease payments.

International organizations are contributing money to a global program of support for this vulnerable ecosystem in order to lessen the strain caused by lost revenue. However, donors are concerned that the monies may not reach the intended recipients due to low technological advancement, internet access and absence of a verifiable financial system to bridge the gap between the donors and the beneficiaries.

<h2>Our Solution</h2>

MachoMara, coined from the Swahili word Macho and Mara which means “Eyes of Mara” is a Decentralised Donation platform that takes advantage the Security and Transparency of the Blockchain technology to provide a secure, fast and verifiable channel for individual and organization donors to donate to the course of preserving our wildlife.
By integrating AML and identity check), we guarantee secure transactions from credible donors and beneficiaries, thereby ensuring that our platform is not a channel for fraudulent activities.
MachoMara, unlike various De-Fi and traditional donation platforms already existing, utilizes USSD and M-Pesa to provide last-mile payment service to the beneficiaries, this successfully bridges the gap hindering the adoption of Blockchain in remote parts of Africa, especially the Masai Mara.

MachoMara - Blockchain in Wildlife Preservation

One of the challenges facing conservancies and individual land owners is lack of adequate funding, and that isn’t entirely because there are no donations coming, but also because of the cost of getting the donations across to the intended beneficiaries. 
Using traditional systems, donors will have to rely on various agencies and organizations who act as middlemen. The major role of these middlemen is, but not limited to, serving as channels between the donors and the beneficiaries. This comes with a huge cost, and also creates room for concerns, especially in respect to transparency and accountability.  
With the use of Blockchain, MachoMara has created a transparent, cost efficient link between the donors, regardless of their country, and the beneficiaries. We partner with the conservancies to curate a record of the individual land owners and some other key players in the ecosystem who form the beneficiaries.
